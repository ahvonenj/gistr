## Why?

gistr is designed to be a small and a simple tool to quickly pull files from Github's Gists. You may have that useful `index.css` or something else saved, which you always use as a base for all your projects, but it is a hassle to find and fetch all those various snippets, as well as utility- and base-files every time, as they have probably been scattered among various different projects and gists.

Simply put - the goal, when using this tool, is that you can start building your own "database" of different kinds of files, which you can then easily fetch for your other projects.

## Gists?

As I could not figure out anything better to use and I don't want to host files on a server of my own - I decided to use Github's Gists as a starting storage for files.

## Usage

`npm install -g gistr`
